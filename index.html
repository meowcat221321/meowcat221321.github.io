    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p> Inside the mystery black box is a water capturing mechanism where water has to reach a certain amount in order for water to come out. </p>
    <h1> Evidence </h1>
    <p> In the mystery black box, water is put in and less comes out. In the original black box, when 500 ml was put in, 0 ml came out. In trials afterwards, the same amount of water was put in, but the output was usually less than or equal to the input. In our groupâ€™s approach, we highlighted the feature of water being captured and stuck in the box. When we made our model, we used buckets to carry the water through the box and keep some inside. The results were similar to the original box where we put in 320-400 ml each time and less water would come off. Just like the first trial for the black box, our first trial had an output of 0 ml. We also noticed that smaller amounts have a faster time going through the original box system, so we made it so that when bigger amounts are poured in, it has a harder time getting through by using tubing that can carry a smaller amount.</p>
    <h1> Reasoning </h1>
    <p> The water capturing mechanism is meant to keep some water inside the box through being stuck in the bottom of the bucket. We allowed for smaller amounts to go through our model easier by having tubing be placed slightly above where the water would sit in the bucket and also using thin tubes to carry the water, so that if larger amounts were put in, the water would be rushed through and be slowed down.</p>
